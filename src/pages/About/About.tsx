              This website is a simple react app written in typescripts using a Apollo 3.0 for local state management.
              I also integrated tailwind for all the CSS and created some test cases in Jest to ensure my calenders always working.
              I deployed with Google Firebase using Github Actions for CI/CD.

              The history page is something i wrote for fun. I use todays date to
              calculate the week, the week is used to calculate the month, the
              month is used calculate year, then i use the year calculation to go
              all the way back to my birthday. Each day will request 10 New York Times articles from that day. I plan to implement many other free use APIs.-{" "}

              My name is Tochy and I am a Nigerian born American living in Texas.
              I have lived in Texas most of my life. My family first flew to the
              city of Garland when I was 4 years old. School was an interesting
              experience. I got into the gifted and talented program which gave me
              the opportunity to take advanced classes earlier than the curriculum
              scheduled.

              I got kinda lazy during high school but I was able to find my
              passion in software development. I took an AP comp sci class and
              even though I did not pass the actual exam, I recruited all my
              friends to sign up for it the next year. I took advantage of being
              the teacher aid for the AP comp sci class the following year and
              found another passion for teaching. I took both of these passions
              home with me and threw it onto my 2 younger brothers and now they
              are both on track to become better developers than I am.

              I got super focused in community college, joining the Phi Theta
              Kappa Honor Society and transferring to UTA with 2 scholarships.
              University was honestly a wild experience but completely worth every
              second. I admit to struggling when I first transferred trying to
              find a balance in life, work and school. I eventually joined the
              army to both help pay for school and get some much needed
              discipline. I am no longer in the army but I carry the lessons with
              me. I truly believe in finding joy in work. There is so many
              beautiful things in life and computer science give people nearly
              unlimited tools to create more beautiful things.
